# profanity2

Profanity is a high performance (probably the fastest!) vanity address generator for Ethereum. Create cool customized addresses that you never realized you needed! Recieve Ether in style! Wow!

# Important to know

A previous version of this project has a known critical issue due to a bad source of randomness. The issue enables attackers to recover private key from public key: https://blog.1inch.io/a-vulnerability-disclosed-in-profanity-an-ethereum-vanity-address-tool-68ed7455fc8c

This project "profanity2" was forked from the original project and modified to guarantee **safety by design**. This means source code of this project do not require any audits, but still guarantee safe usage.

Project "profanity2" is not generating key anymore, instead it adjusts user-provided public key until desired vanity address will be discovered. Users provide seed public key in form of 128-symbol hex string with `-z` parameter flag. Resulting private key should be used to be added to seed private key to achieve final private key of the desired vanity address (private keys are just 256-bit numbers). Running "profanity2" can even be outsourced to someone completely unreliable - it is still safe by design.

## Getting public key for mandatory `-z` parameter

Generate private key and public key via openssl in terminal (remove prefix "04" from public key):
```bash
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 -text -noout -outform DER | xxd -p -c 1000 | sed 's/41534e31204f49443a20736563703235366b310a30740201010420/Private Key: /' | sed 's/a00706052b8104000aa144034200/\'$'\nPublic Key: /'
```

Derive public key from existing private key via openssl in terminal (remove prefix "04" from public key):
```bash
$ openssl ec -inform DER -text -noout -in <(cat <(echo -n "302e0201010420") <(echo -n "PRIVATE_KEY_HEX") <(echo -n "a00706052b8104000a") | xxd -r -p) 2>/dev/null | tail -6 | head -5 | sed 's/[ :]//g' | tr -d '\n' && echo
```

## Adding private keys (never use online calculators!)

### Terminal:

Use private keys as 64-symbol hexadecimal string WITHOUT `0x` prefix:
```bash
(echo 'ibase=16;obase=10' && (echo '(PRIVATE_KEY_A + PRIVATE_KEY_B) % FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F' | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')) | bc
```

### Python

Use private keys as 64-symbol hexadecimal string WITH `0x` prefix:
```bash
$ python3
>>> hex((PRIVATE_KEY_A + PRIVATE_KEY_B) % 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F)
```

# Usage
```
usage: ./profanity2 [OPTIONS]

  Mandatory args:
    -z                      Seed public key to start, add it's private key
                            to the "profanity2" resulting private key.

  Basic modes:
    --benchmark             Run without any scoring, a benchmark.
    --zeros                 Score on zeros anywhere in hash.
    --letters               Score on letters anywhere in hash.
    --numbers               Score on numbers anywhere in hash.
    --mirror                Score on mirroring from center.
    --leading-doubles       Score on hashes leading with hexadecimal pairs

  Modes with arguments:
    --leading <single hex>  Score on hashes leading with given hex character.
    --matching <hex string> Score on hashes matching given hex string.

  Advanced modes:
    --contract              Instead of account address, score the contract
                            address created by the account's zeroth transaction.
    --leading-range         Scores on hashes leading with characters within
                            given range.
    --range                 Scores on hashes having characters within given
                            range anywhere.

  Range:
    -m, --min <0-15>        Set range minimum (inclusive), 0 is '0' 15 is 'f'.
    -M, --max <0-15>        Set range maximum (inclusive), 0 is '0' 15 is 'f'.

  Device control:
    -s, --skip <index>      Skip device given by index.
    -n, --no-cache          Don't load cached pre-compiled version of kernel.

  Tweaking:
    -w, --work <size>       Set OpenCL local work size. [default = 64]
    -W, --work-max <size>   Set OpenCL maximum work size. [default = -i * -I]
    -i, --inverse-size      Set size of modular inverses to calculate in one
                            work item. [default = 255]
    -I, --inverse-multiple  Set how many above work items will run in
                            parallell. [default = 16384]

  Examples:
    ./profanity2 --leading f -z HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG
    ./profanity2 --matching dead -z HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG
    ./profanity2 --matching badXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXbad -z HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG
    ./profanity2 --leading-range -m 0 -M 1 -z HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG
    ./profanity2 --leading-range -m 10 -M 12 -z HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG
    ./profanity2 --range -m 0 -M 1 -z HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG
    ./profanity2 --contract --leading 0 -z HEX_PUBLIC_KEY_128_CHARS_LONG
